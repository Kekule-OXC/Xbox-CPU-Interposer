# Xbox-CPU-Interposer

the gerbers and BOM for my CPU interposer.  I will try and add some more documentation as recover from my injury.  Released under the GPL for now.

The "nospeed"  gerbers have the speed switch circuit cut from the PCB.

I suggest ordering 1.2mm thick board.  1.6 will work, but it takes some extra heat to attach it to the motherboard

12-14-2023: I have fixed the "speed removed" gerbers and restored the pull up on the speed step circuit.
